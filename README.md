## Name
SudMig - **SUD**an: monitoring **MIG**rant movements related to the 2023 conflict.

## Description
The SudMig project aims at developing an interactive dashboard that provides valuable insights on the latest Sudanese internal migration. This is done by developing a well-founded underlying SDI (Spatial Data Infrastructure) strategy for the efficient and transparent gathering, processing and sharing of the migration geodata and the effective visualization in an informative dashboard. The SudMig dashboard, thereby, supports United Nation’s decision-making processes related to the 2023 military conflict which causes millions to flee to other parts of the country and neighbouring countries.    

Different parameters related to Sudanese internal migration, such as the number of Internally Displaced People (IDPs), their origin and destination within Sudan, the demographics as well as geocoded data, like Sudan’s administrative boundaries, will be collected, organized, and visualized effectively. The data will be organized and stored in a PostgreSQL (PostGIS) database management system and published with web-services, such as the OGC Web Map Service and Web Feature Service. Finally, the data will be integrated into the SudMig dashboard, so that our important migration parameters and trends can create impact by being communicated to the decision-makers briefly and at a glance.
