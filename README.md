## Name
SudMig - **Sud**an: monitoring **Mig**rant movements related to the 2023 conflict.

## Description
The SudMig project aims at developing an interactive dashboard that provides valuable insights on the latest Sudanese internal migration. This is done by developing a well-founded underlying SDI (Spatial Data Infrastructure) strategy for the efficient and transparent gathering, processing and sharing of the migration geodata and the effective visualization in an informative dashboard. The SudMig dashboard, thereby, supports United Nation’s decision-making processes related to the 2023 military conflict which causes millions to flee to other parts of the country and neighbouring countries.    

Different parameters related to Sudanese internal migration, such as the number of Internally Displaced People (IDPs), their origin and destination within Sudan, the demographics as well as geocoded data, like Sudan’s administrative boundaries, will be collected, organized, and visualized effectively. The data will be organized and stored in a PostgreSQL (PostGIS) database management system and published with web-services, such as the OGC Web Map Service and Web Feature Service. Finally, the data will be integrated into the SudMig dashboard, so that our important migration parameters and trends can create impact by being communicated to the decision-makers briefly and at a glance.

## Folder structure
Please find in the repository the SudMig documents and data. <br> In the 'Project_management' folder you find:
- the up-to-date Gantt Chart (.xlsx)
- the up-to-date time sheets of the authors (.xlsx)
- the granted project proposal (.pdf)
- the mid-term project presentation (.pdf)
- the final project report (will be added by end of January)
- the project milestones (.xlsx)
- the work breakdown diagram (.pptx)
- the (initial) project idea (.docx)

In the 'Data' folder you find:
- the geodata ('SudMig_Sudan_AdmBoundaries_Level1.zip') that was used to geocode the actual migration data (.shp) <br>
- the geocoded migration data ('SudMig_Monthly_IDPs_Displacement.zip') which was joined with the geodata by using the state of displacement of IDPs (.shp) <br>
- the geocoded migration data ('SudMig_Monthly_IDPs_Origin.zip') which was joined with the geodata by using the state of origin of IDPs (.shp) <br>

The 'Metadata' folder will be filled with metadata information in early January.
